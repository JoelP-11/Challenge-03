Password generator hw
In this challenge assignment I developed a password generator. The HTML and CSS was already provided so all I did was link the JavaScript file and CSS file to the HTML file. I started things off by declaring the 4 main arrays which were special characters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters. I then created a function that gives you a prompt once you click the "generate password" button on the website. answering the prompt then pops up 4 more prompts which help curate a password that is preferred to the user. I also included an if statement incase a user is to click no on every single prompt, it will then ask them to next time select yes on at least one since we can't give generate a password with no on everything. I also added math variables to help make the generator as random as possible when choosing from its potential list of outputs. And finally I added an event listener for a "click" so that whenever the user clicks the generate password button, that is the programs queue to start asking the prompts and generating the password. Below I have left a link for the deployed website and have also included a screenshot with a randomly generated password.
